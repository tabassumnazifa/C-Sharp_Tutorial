Loops in C#
A loop in C# is a control structure that repeats a block of code based on a conditionâ€”useful for tasks like printing, processing arrays, or reading input.

ðŸ§  Types of Loops
âœ… for loop
Used when the number of iterations is known.
Example:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    Console.WriteLine(i);
âœ… while loop
Checks the condition before each iteration.
Example:
int i = 0;
while (i < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
}
âœ… do-while loop
Executes at least once, checks condition after.
Example:
int i = 0;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
âœ… foreach loop
Used to iterate through collections like arrays.
Example:
string[] names = { "Nazifa", "Ayesha", "Lamia" };
foreach (string name in names)
    Console.WriteLine(name);
