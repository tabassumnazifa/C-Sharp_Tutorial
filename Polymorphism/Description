âœ… What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means "many forms." In C#, it allows methods to behave differently based on the context â€” such as different parameter types or class hierarchy.

ðŸ§© Types of Polymorphism in C#
**Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)
---Achieved through Method Overloading.
---The decision is made during compile-time.
**Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)
---Achieved through Method Overriding using virtual and override.
---The decision is made at runtime.
---Requires inheritance and base class reference.
âœ¨ Benefits of Polymorphism:
---Increases code reusability.
---Supports clean code and open/closed principle.
---Makes it easier to maintain and extend applications.
