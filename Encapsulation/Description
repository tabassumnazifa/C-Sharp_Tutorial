ðŸ”’ Encapsulation in C# â€“ Key Points:
--Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal data and exposing only necessary parts via public methods or properties.
--Achieved using access modifiers: private, public, protected, etc.
--Helps enforce data security and integrity by restricting direct access to class fields.
--Private fields are accessed or modified through public properties or methods (getters and setters).
--Encourages modularity, maintainability, and code reusability.
--Allows you to add validation logic while setting data (e.g., age > 0).
