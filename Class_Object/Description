📚 Basic Concept: Class and Object in C#
In C#, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (data/fields) and methods (functions) that the created objects can have.

An object is an instance of a class — it holds actual values and can use the methods defined in the class.
🔍 Summary:
class: defines the structure.

object: real instance based on the class.

A class can have multiple objects.

Objects access data and behavior using dot notation (objectName.Property, objectName.Method())
