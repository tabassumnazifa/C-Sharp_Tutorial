âœ… User Input	                  The program uses Console.ReadLine() with Convert.ToInt32() to safely take numeric input from users for array sizes and elements.
âœ… 1D Array                    	A single-dimensional array where users define the size and enter each element. It's printed linearly.
âœ… 2D Array                    	A matrix-style array with rows and columns. Users define dimensions and enter values by position. It's printed row by row.
âœ… Jagged Array	                An array of arrays where each row can have a different number of elements. Users define the number of rows and each row's length individually.
